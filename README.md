# CodeWith Mobbing Session!

## The challenge

Build a vending machine. The vending machine accepts coins and allows you to make a selection from its inventory. The vending machine will dispense the item you have selected if you gave it enough money. If you don't have enough money, it will give you your money back.

## TDD

Test-Driven-Development. For each bit of functionality, we will:

- Write a failing test
- Write code that makes the test pass
- Make the code better
- Repeat

This loop is known as Red-Green-Refactor.

The idea is that by writing tests first, we will naturally produce more testable and decoupled code. It will also hopefully help as a design tool as we build our vending machine!
